# --description--

Now that you can count tasks in the Priority Party Planner, let's move on to sorting them. In this step, you'll modify your 'planPartyTasks' function to sort tasks based on their priority. Remember, a lower priority number means the task is more urgent.

Your updated function should still accept an array of task objects, each with properties: 'id', 'priority', and 'duration'.

```json
Example task object:
{
  "id": "task1",
  "priority": 1,
  "duration": 30
}
```
