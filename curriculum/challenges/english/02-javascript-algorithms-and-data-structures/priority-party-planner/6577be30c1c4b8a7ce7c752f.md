# --description--

In the Priority Party Planner challenge, you're tasked with creating a function 'planPartyTasks' that organizes party tasks based on their priority and duration. In this step, we'll start by ensuring your function can accept an array of the task objects and return the correct task count.

Each task object in the array has properties: 'id', 'priority', and 'duration'.
